# imgDigest

A hobby project for extracting image metadata and renaming the images according to their date of creation

## Todo
- [ ] **Add Tests**: As in mock tests for the controller functions
- [ ] **Organise Logging**: As it is quite messy for the time being
- [ ] **Dynamically send progress to client**: which is beyond my knowledge
- [ ] **Turn this list into issues**: and write a propper readme instead
- [ ] **Maybe introduce a database**
- [ ] **Add support for audio recordings**: at least one format
