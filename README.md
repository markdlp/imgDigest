# imgDigest

A hobby project for extracting image metadata and renaming the images according to their date of creation

## Todo
- [ ] **Add Tests**: As in mock tests for the controller functions
- [ ] **Organize Logging**: As it is quite messy for the time being
- [ ] **Dynamically send progress to client**: which is beyond my knowledge
- [ ] **Turn this list into issues**: and write a propper readme instead
- [ ] **Maybe introduce a database**
- [ ] **Add support for audio recordings**: at least one format
- [ ] **Maybe Introduce a workspace and a docker-compose.devcontainer.yml**: such as [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container)
- [ ] **Move Dockerfile into .devcontainer**: and make it such that devcontainer.json utilizes docker-compose.yml
- [ ] **Use Alpine as the last Dockefile step**: to minimize executable size
